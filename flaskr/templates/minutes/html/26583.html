<p>“Carried” Accessibility Reviews a) Site Plan Approval for 292 & 396 Lansdowne Street East</p>
<p>Recommendations for the proposed construction of Phase 1, two commercial buildings:</p>
<p>1.  Relocate snow storage area along Lansdowne Street East to ensure there is no</p>
<p>spill over and interference with the walkway that connects the buildings to the Lansdowne Street sidewalk.</p>
<p>2.  Provide a walkway network along the full length of the east property line and</p>
<p>connect walkways to the Willowcreek Trail north of the site.</p>
<p>3.  Accessible parking for building D: relocate so that the parking space location</p>
<p>doesn’t require people to travel across the drive aisle. Reconfigure parking lot as required.</p>
<p>4.  Extend Building ‘E’ walkway the full length of the parking lot, all the way to the</p>
<p>northmost parking area.</p>
<p>5.  Provide a pedestrian walkway network that connects to Willowcreek Plaza</p>
<p>buildings.</p>
<p>6.  Triangular parking spaces in front of Building E could be designated for small</p>
<p>vehicles (e-bikes, motorcycles, etc.)</p>
<p>7.  Install bicycle racks at both buildings and ensure that they do not obstruct the</p>
<p>walkway clear path of travel.</p>
<p>8.  The Committee expressed concern about the need for a pedestrian cross walk across Lansdowne Street, noting that there is potential to locate a driveway in future Phase 2 that aligns with another driveway to a commercial site across Lansdowne Street. Such a feature would make it easier for the City to install traffic control signals with cross walks at that location.</p>
<p>9.  Consider how walkways in Phase 1 could complement walkways to future phases</p>
<p>of this development, allowing pedestrian access between Phase 1 and Phase 2 buildings.</p>

<p>10. A green space amenity area could be created between Phase 1 and Phase 2 for</p>
<p>features such as rest areas for pedestrians and service animals.</p>
<p>11. There appears to be only one type of accessible parking space: parking areas</p>
<p>should include the required larger 3.4 m wide accessible parking space for large vehicles.</p>
<p>12. Double-loaded parking in front of building D: it would be preferable to see single- load parking adjacent to the walkway fronting the building. This would also move the accessible parking spaces directly in front of the building (as noted in item 3, above).</p>
<p>13. Site lighting is not indicated on this plan; the Committee noted that site lighting</p>
<p>should be included as required. Suggestion that lighting could be placed with attention to illumination of curb cuts. The Committee also noted that pedestrian- scale lighting along walkways is an accessibility feature that assists in navigating and wayfinding.</p>
<p>14. Ensure that width of walkways will accommodate large vehicle overhang and still</p>
<p>allow clear path of travel.</p>
<p>15. Door operator locations should be marked on site plan drawings. Plan for door</p>
<p>operator locations to function properly with consideration of the swing of the door.</p>
<p>Other business Review of Abilities Centre in Whitby</p>
<p>Mark Buffone presented photographs of the Abilities Centre facility located in Whitby, which has many design features that could be useful for this committee to consider when making recommendations. Next meeting The next meeting will be held on Tuesday, February 18, 2020 from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. in the Doris Room, City Hall. Adjournment Moved by Andrea Dodsworth That the meeting of the AAC Built Environment Sub-Committee adjourn at 4:50 p.m.</p>
