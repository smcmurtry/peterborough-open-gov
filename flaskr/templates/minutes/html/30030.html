<p>“Carried” Accessibility Reviews a)  Site Plan Approval for 884 Armour Road, SPC 294B</p>
<p>The committee made the following recommendations:</p>
<p>1.  The two accessible parking spaces facing Armour Road should be relocated</p>
<p>toensure they are serviced by a walkway and do not require people to navigate in the parking lot zone. It is unclear if these two spaces serve the two storey dwelling building or the mixed use building. Locate the spaces to suit. The committee indicated that due to the longer distance to access the commercial spaces as well as the higher risk for people with disabilities to navigate across the parking lot adjacent to a loading zone mean that the current location of these parking spaces is not optimal.</p>
<p>2.  The diagonal pedestrian path that crosses the parking lot and the L shaped</p>
<p>tactile attention indicator on the northwest side of the parking lot may be challenging for people with low vision to navigate. A straight path of travel from the Armour Road sidewalk, serving both the two storey dwelling building and the plaza would be preferable.</p>
<p>3.  Lighting should be incorporated into the centre island parking area.</p>
<p>4.  Permeable pavers can shift with weather changes, creating an uneven surface area. They are not ideal for use in accessible parking spaces. The committee strongly recommends avoiding use of permeable pavers at accessible parking spaces, where there is opportunity to provide them in other areas of the site. Where there are site constraints, the committee recommends only the accessible parking spaces are constructed in permeable pavers, not the access aisles beside the parking spaces. Asphalt access aisles would be preferred.</p>
<p>5.  At the southwest corner of the walkway of the new building, the drop curb needs</p>
<p>tactile attention indicators.</p>
<p>6.  Provide retaining walls, guards and railings along the walkways located at the</p>
<p>north and east side of the plaza building, as required.</p>
<p>7.  Provide vision strips for all storefront windows adjacent to storefront doors.</p>
