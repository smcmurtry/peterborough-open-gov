<p>“Carried” Accessibility Reviews a)  Site Plan Approval for 362 & 380 George St. N., SPC-996</p>
<p>The committee expressed strong support for the planned accessible entrance to the Speak Easy indicated in the South Elevation Site drawing.</p>
<p>The committee made the following recommendations:</p>
<p>1.  Install power door operators for all commercial properties at street level.</p>
<p>2.  Ensure that doorways to businesses are clearly demarked. For example, high- contrast paint on door trim could be used (with colours that are also acceptable based on Heritage parameters) as part of planned façade upgrades. Markings on glass surfaces may also be used to provide contrast between store front windows and doorways. The committee also referenced the use of strategically placed brightly coloured planters used at the Peterborough Public Library, as an alternative method to help define the building entrance vs. adjacent glazing, where space permits.</p>
<p>3.  Use high-contrast materials on all interior stairways and railings.</p>
<p>4.  Doors to residences should be easy to identify in contrast with the hallway wall</p>
<p>surfaces (e.g. use of high-contrast floor materials, trim and/or paint).</p>
<p>5.  The Committee noted an opportunity to create an accessible unit with the single ground-level residence at the back of the building, and encourages the developer to consider this as designs are finalized.</p>
