<p>Reconciliation Motion</p>
<p>Moved by Councillor Baldwin Seconded by Councillor Vassiliadis</p>
<p>Whereas we are settlers on these lands of the Ojibwe Nation (Treaty 20 territory- the Williams Treaty) and as an ally to the Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island, I ask that city council consider a meaningful action to bring awareness and further education about Canada's history of Residential Schools.</p>
<p>We ask that a city bus be wrapped in orange and bear the Every Child Matters logo to show Peterborough's commitment to reconciliation. Although September 30th has finally been acknowledged as a federal statutory holiday, there are still far too many people who are unaware of the horrific history of our government (in conjunction with Religious Organizations) and it's attempt to destroy the culture and communities of First Nation, Inuit and Metis peoples.</p>
<p>By wrapping a city bus, Peterborough can make a highly visible statement that it is committed to spreading awareness and acknowledging the truth of our nation's history. There can be no reconciliation without truth, and no truth without acknowledgement. Please consider taking this simple, effective action on behalf of the children who never made it home, as well as the generations of survivors who are still affected by these horrors of history.</p>
