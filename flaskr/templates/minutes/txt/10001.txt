Asbestos Resolution
Moved by Councillor Parnell, seconded by Councillor Riel


Whereas, it is estimated that more than 2,000 people die every year from diseases caused by asbestos exposure, like mesothelioma and lung cancer. Death from mesothelioma increased by 60 percent between 2000 and 2012.
Whereas, Asbestos-related diseases are on the rise: In 1992, there were 276 recorded cases of mesothelioma. Twenty years later the number of new cases of mesothelioma has more than doubled, with 560 recorded in 2012.
Whereas, Asbestos imports into Canada are increasing: Imports of asbestos- related items rose to $8.2 million in 2015.
Whereas, In addition to their health, Canadians' jobs are being put at risk: Canada is importing replacement brake pads and linings containing asbestos, despite the fact that Canada manufactures non-asbestos replacement alternatives.
Therefore be it Resolved, That the City of Peterborough will support the Canadian Labour Congress' call for a comprehensive ban on asbestos.
City Council Minutes
Meeting of December 12, 2016

Arbitration System
Moved by Councillor McWilliams, seconded by Councillor Vassiliadis
That the following motion be sent to Peterborough MPP Jeff Leal:
a)        That City Council of the City of Peterborough urges the provincial
government to reform the interest arbitration system for emergency services that has contributed to the cost of emergency services rising faster than other municipal services, the cost of living and the rate of inflation; and,
b)       That City Council requests that Peterborough MPP Jeff Leal provide
information on how his government is responding to requests from the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, Eastern Ontario Mayors Committee and Wardens Caucus and individual municipalities to reform the interest arbitration for emergency services beyond the modest amendments being made through Bill 70, Building Ontario Up for Everyone Act (Budget Measures), 2016, which will amend the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, 1997 but does not directly deal with the arbitration system’s tendency to fail to adequately consider the local taxpayer’s ability to pay or the substantial difference between large urban municipalities and smaller communities when comparing salaries for emergency services workers.
