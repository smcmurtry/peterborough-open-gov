Reports and Communications

Transportation Master Plan - Phase 3 Update

PEAC21-024

Moved by Mary Elizabeth Konrad

That the Peterborough Environmental Advisory Committee approve the
recommendation outlined in Report PEAC21-024 dated October 20, 2021, of the
Manager – Transportation Division as follows:

That the presentation from the Transportation Division regarding the
Transportation Master Plan – Phase 3 Update be received for information; and,

That the following comments be provided:

  The presentation was detailed and well done

  However, it should include actual measured current percent mode

share numbers to make the change/shift of each modelled scenario
clearer

  How the TMP reflects the climate change emergency

  We need to make radical changes to address climate change and the

proposals do not seem to address this
  Question setting achievable goals rather than goals that reflect the
urgency of the climate change situation
  City needs to move towards EVs for the fleet (and ultimately for
public transit)
  Concern with survey methodology
  Concern that questions were leading to a particular conclusion   Need to reframe questions with more positivity, showing examples of
the lifestyle promoted/supported by these policy changes
  Survey is only completed by those who choose to do so   Some survey questions were out of sync with the timing of some
decisions in both phase 2 (i.e., cycling) and phase 3 (land use planning)
  Survey asked participants for feedback on mode percentages that
had not yet been supported by modelling (the model later suggested that the measures in each scenario could not achieve the targeted mode share) percentages)

Incentivize electric vehicles and use of transit
  Size of City and density does not lend itself to complete/walkable
communities, so EVs and public transit must be used to see radical emissions reduction
  Possible support/incentive for installing home Level 2 (50A
240V) charging stations to increase convenience
  Possible support/incentive and education for purchase of new and
used EVs and PHEVs
  Consider exempting ‘green license plate’ vehicles from parking fees



  Encouraging/incentivizing taxi and private transportation companies
to move to EVs
  Expand use of parking fees
  Revenue generated can be used to offset costs of programs   Culture shift through punitive measures and EV/PHEV
parking incentives mentioned earlier; clearly communicate the rationale for punitive measures
  Survey feedback on increased parking costs and congestion fees is
evidence that punitive measures will be very effective at discouraging vehicle usage Institute parking fees on all City streets to encourage fewer vehicles
   Address concerns around the impact parking changes would have on small downtown businesses (e.g. by providing strategic parking options close to the downtown)
  Begin with pilot projects i.e. fees for parking at City Hall for staff and
Council members and/or incentives for not using a vehicle or for using an EV/PHEV
  Community Safety
  Speed limit reductions (also may reduce emissions and ‘calming’
infrastructure costs) to:
  40 km/h in local neighbourhoods, and   30 km/h in the downtown core
  When addressing mode shifts, place more emphasis on sidewalks
and walking as the focus currently seems to be on cycling and transit
  Undertake road safety programs with neighbourhoods   Clear link to Vision Zero principles and a philosophy of safety in
design for all transportation infrastructure
  Consider including climate change adaptation costs and EA requirement
costs in infrastructure cost estimates
