Applications
1.
File No. A41/21, 26 Krogh Road
This matter relates to a minor variance application submitted by Chris Page and Lori Page, the owners of the property that is the subject of the application.
The purpose of the application is to reduce the minimum building setback from a side lot line of a main building from 3 metres to 0.597 metres to facilitate the construction of an attached garage with loft at the subject property.
Chris Page attended the meeting and addressed the Committee as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
They are applying for a minor variance to reduce the building setback to the site lot line to permit the construction of a garage with a loft. There is not currently a garage on the property and the house has limited storage space. The loft above the garage will be used for additional storage. In consultation with staff, the request was revised to increase the requested setback from the side lot line from 0.597 metres to 0.9 metres. They will be able to comply with the condition requiring the submission of a grading plan prior to applying for a Building Permit. They are satisfied with the Recommendation outlined in the Staff Report.
Christie Gilbertson, Planner, Policy and Research, advised that following publication of the Staff Report, Staff completed a review of the parking requirements and determined that since the property is located in Parking Area 3, the City of Peterborough zoning regulations for the minimum size of a required parking space apply to the property.

Therefore, the two required parking spaces can be established in the garage measuring 2.7 metres by 5.7 metres, rather than the former Township requirement of 3 metres by 6 metres. Since the required parking is shown in the concept plan submitted by the applicant on October 4, 2021, Staff are no longer recommending the second condition outlined in the report.
No one spoke in objection to the application and no written objections were received.
That the revised application be approved in accordance with the recommendation in the Staff Report, excepting recommended condition ii, requiring submission of a concept site plan.

Decision
The Committee received no comment or presentation from members of the public concerning the application and thus made its decision on the basis of the Staff Report and the application.
Having reviewed the application and considered the information presented both in the Staff Report and presentation, the Committee determined that the revised application for a lesser variance of 0.9 metres should be approved. The Committee acknowledged that parking meeting the by-law regulations was adequately illustrated by the concept plan submitted by the applicant on October 4, 2021 and that the second proposed condition was not required. The Committee determined that the variance is minor, the proposal is desirable for the appropriate development or use of the land, and the general intent and purpose of the Zoning By-law and Official Plan are maintained.
Therefore, a variance is granted to Section 8 (2(h(i of the Township of Otonabee Zoning By-law (12-79 to reduce the minimum building setback from a side lot line of a main building to 0.9 metres to facilitate the construction of an attached garage with loft PROVIDED THAT the use of the second storey loft is limited to a storage area and is not converted to habitable living space and that construction related to this approval proceed substantially in accordance with the concept plan prepared by Kingdon Timber Mart and dated October 4, 2021. Approval is CONDITIONAL UPON submission and approval of a partial grading plan to the satisfaction of the Development Engineer to demonstrate positive drainage in the area of the reduced setback along the side lot line.
