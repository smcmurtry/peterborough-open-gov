<p>Allison Seiderer entered meeting, 4:00 p.m. Accessibility Reviews a) Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendment for 1045-1063 Armour Road and 941, 949, and 957 Ashdale Crescent.</p>
<p>The committee supports the overall shift to increased densification to existing residential zones per the draft Official Plan, but has made the following recommendations:</p>
<p>1.  Make at least one of the townhouse units accessible.</p>
<p>2.  Accessible parking spaces should be relocated to more convenient locations.</p>
<p>3.  There is a lot of extra road space: noted that if townhouse units weren’t designed</p>
<p>back-to-back, less road space would be required</p>
<p>4.  The stairs leading to the proposed Park Space are a barrier. Provide zero step</p>
<p>access to park spaces serving the development.</p>
<p>5.  Outdoor Amenity Spaces: The Committee noted an overall lack of quality</p>
<p>greenspace/outdoor amenity spaces, and the remoteness of the marked park spaces. The Committee made several recommendations to resolve this:</p>
<p>a)  That the City require a clearly articulated accessible greenspace/outdoor</p>
<p>amenity space in any agreements with the developer</p>
<p>b)  The road between Block 7/10 and Block 8/9 could be removed, leaving a</p>
<p>large, centrally-located area that could be shared outdoor amenity space/green space. Additional visitor parking could be included along the east and west sides of this space.</p>
<p>6.  Any playground equipment in proposed Tot Lot, Park Space should meet</p>
<p>applicable CSA standards, be accessible by walkway connections and include accessible features such as accessible ground surfacing, accessible benches and shade cover.</p>
<p>Appendix A</p>
<p>Minutes of the AAC Built Environment Sub-Committee February 18, 2020</p>
<p>Page 3 7.  Rooftop greenspace would have limitations regarding accessibility and should not</p>
<br>
<p>be included in outdoor amenity space calculations.</p>
<p>8.  Walkways should be extended along frontages of all units (missing from Blocks 9,</p>
<p>10, 12-15 and partially missing from Blocks 6, 7, 8, and 11)</p>
<p>9.  The committee noted a lack of commercial amenities in this neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Given the densification proposed to this area, they expressed support for rezoning the lands to permit future commercial amenities.</p>
<p>10.  Adequate lighting is essential in parking lots, along all walkways and in parks.</p>
<p>11.  Include a transit stop, potentially entering the development east from Armour</p>
<p>Road at the northwest intersection in front of Block 11 and Block 10.</p>
<p>b) Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendment for 850 Lansdowne Street West</p>
<p>Keith Payne left meeting, 4:20 p.m.</p>
<p>1.  Require tactile attention indicators along edge of concrete walkway in front of</p>
<p>building. Curb stops are also recommended for these parking spaces.</p>
<p>2.  Provide additional accessible parking spaces. Optimal location is beside current</p>
<p>barrier-free space at front of building.</p>
<p>3.  Clear path of travel along walkway at front of building is obstructed by existing</p>
<p>columns that are not shown on the site plan.</p>
<p>4.  Gas meter on the east side of the building should be protected by bollards.</p>
<p>Potential impact of these on the width of driveway between building an angled parking spaces adjacent to the gas meter.</p>
<p>5.  The existing picnic table amenity space adjacent to concrete walkway on the</p>
<p>north side of building has three existing steps, limiting access. Provide zero step access to picnic table area.</p>
<p>6.  Realign the Whiteman Avenue driveway further north to avoid conflicts with the</p>
<p>loading space when occupied during deliveries. Relocate landscaping to suit. Ensure drive aisle surrounding east and north side of the building accommodates larger vehicles navigating to Whiteman Avenue.</p>
<p>7.  Address conflict with first angled parking space near the Lansdowne driveway entrance: realign curb and narrow the driveway entrance to protect this space.</p>
<p>8.  Garbage disposal area should be clearly identified on Site Plan.</p>
<p>9.  Create a walkway that connects the building entrance to the existing sidewalk on</p>
<p>Lansdowne Street West.</p>
