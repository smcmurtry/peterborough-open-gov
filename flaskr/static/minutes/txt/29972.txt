a)








c)
d)
e)
f)
b)
Climate change must appear early in the document and be a key feature of the OP emphasizing:
  The urgency of the climate crisis with an affirmation of the city’s
commitment to action upheld by the land use policies enshrined in this OP
  Recognition that Climate Change is one of the most important
factors influencing the health, safety, and future prosperity of our community
  Highlight the influence that climate change will have on planning and
infrastructure looking outward to the end of the plan in 2051
  State the targets and dates from city council’s 2019 Climate Change Emergency Declaration, and highlight that our first greenhouse gas emissions milestone is in 2030, which is only 9 years away from this new OP
The language be strengthened (i.e. “encourage” and ‘consider” to “shall” or “will” statements). PEAC believes the OP is a better document where it is specific and more prescriptive.
Radical changes need to be made in the early years of the OP if we plan to reach a decarbonized future by 2051.
The OP needs to address the changes that are coming in terms of alternative fuel sources, modes of transportation, green infrastructure and low impact development.
PEAC believes that the OP should address how the goals of the plan are monitored and evaluated.
