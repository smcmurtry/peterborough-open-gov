Eye Care for Seniors
Moved by Councillor Parnell Seconded by Councillor Vassiliadis
That the City of Peterborough send a letter of support for the application by the Canadian Mental Health Association and the Ross Memorial Hospital for funding for the New Adult Addiction Services Beds and,
That the City of Peterborough work with the Canadian Mental Health Association and other community partners to apply for the same funding in Peterborough either by an extension of the current program or by applying for the next round of funding.
Whereas routine eye care is critical in early detection of eye diseases like glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration, and the health of eyes is critical to overall health and quality of life; and
Whereas, for most seniors, normal age-related vision loss can be corrected with glasses, medication, or surgery and early detection can help seniors stay safe and independent; and
Whereas payments to Optometrists from OHIP have only increased 9% over the last 30 years, which is far from matching inflation of costs (which include rent, staff, utilities, equipment, taxes and supplies); and
Whereas the lack of funding has led Optometrists to absorb approximately 173 million dollars annually and makes it difficult to invest in modern technology that leads to earlier detection of eye disease; and



Whereas the 2021 Ontario Budget did not address OH IP-insured eye care, Ontario Optometrists took action and voted to withdraw services from OHIP- covered patients, those aged 0-19, 65+, and individuals living with specific eye conditions or diabetes, starting September 1, 2021, unless the government agrees to legally-binding negotiations to fund these services at least to the cost of delivery; and
Whereas this job action will jeopardize good eyecare for those who need the care of an optometrist the most and will have the greatest impact on the most vulnerable groups such as the elderly, who are at the greatest risk for vision- threatening ocular diseases;
Now Therefore, be it resolved that the City of Peterborough requests that the Provincial government recognize the value that access to quality eye care brings to all Ontarians and act now to protect it; and further
That the Provincial government address the OHIP-insured eye care immediately by negotiating Ontario Optometrists to fund these services at least to the cost of delivery; and further
That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to Premier Ford, Ontario Minister of Health Christine Elliot, MPP Dave Smith, MPP David Piccini, MPP Laurie Scott, to the Ontario Association of Optometrists, and to all municipalities in Ontario.
