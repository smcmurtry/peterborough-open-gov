Whereas, when MP Singh visited Peterborough on May 10 th , he was subjected to behaviour that the vast majority of the community completely and unequivocally condemns, Whereas, regardless of political leanings, a cornerstone of a healthy, functioning democracy is to engage in civil discourse without personal attacks and without violent threats, Whereas, the Council for the City of Peterborough wishes all residents and visitors to our community to feel safe and welcomed, and to experience the generosity of spirit of the good people who live here, not the hateful actions of a few, Therefore, be it resolved that the Mayor\u2019s Office, on behalf of City Council, send Mr. Singh a letter, inviting him to return to our community for a discussion and to demonstrate that the recent actions of a small group are not an accurate representation of the people of Peterborough.", "for": ["Councillor Akapo", "Councillor Baldwin", "Councillor Beamer", "Councillor Clarke", "Councillor Pappas", "Councillor Riel", "Mayor Therrien", "Councillor Vassiliadis", "Councillor Wright", "Councillor Zippel Absent (1): Councillor Parnell"], "carried": true, "against": []}, {"title": "22-028 - Being a By-law to confirm the proceedings of the Council at its regular meeting held on May 24, 2022", "for": ["Councillor Akapo", "Councillor Baldwin", "Councillor Beamer", "Councillor Clarke", "Councillor Pappas", "Councillor Riel", "Mayor Therrien", "Councillor Vassiliadis", "Councillor Wright", "Councillor Zippel Absent (1): Councillor Parnell"], "carried": true, "against": []}, {"title": "", "for": ["Councillor Akapo", "Councillor Baldwin", "Councillor Beamer", "Councillor Clarke", "Councillor Pappas", "Councillor Riel", "Mayor Therrien", "Councillor Vassiliadis", "Councillor Wright", "Councillor Zippel Absent (1): Councillor Parnell"], "carried": true, "against": []}]
